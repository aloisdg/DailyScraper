# DailyScraper

## Summary

My submission for the [Challenge #250](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/41hp6u/20160118_challenge_250_easy_scraping/) Scraping  [/r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/). Got it but with some twists. I coded everything in .NETFiddle, so sorry if I made some mistakes. I miss VS. You can try my code [here](https://dotnetfiddle.net/4mpJn6).

## Caveat

* I used the sub's RSS to get submissions.
* I merged `Weekly/Bonus` into an `Other` category.
* I didnt parse by Date. RSS did it.

_Laziness is the main reason behind this..._
